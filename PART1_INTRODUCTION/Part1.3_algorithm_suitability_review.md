# 1.3 Algorithm Suitability Review

To address the problem of finding the fastest evacuation route through a post-landslide road network, several algorithm design paradigms were evaluated for their suitability. Each is assessed based on its ability to solve weighted single-source shortest path problems on a sparse, undirected graph.

## Sorting Algorithms

**Strengths:**
- Simple and fast (O(n log n) for comparison-based sorting).
- Useful as a preprocessing step — e.g., sorting edges by weight for other algorithms.
- Can quickly identify the single lightest edge or the lightest adjacent road from the hospital.

**Weaknesses:**
- Sorting alone cannot find a shortest **path** — it can rank edges, but has no mechanism to aggregate paths across multiple hops.
- It cannot model cumulative travel time through a sequence of connected roads.
- Does not respect the graph's topology — sorting edges independently ignores connectivity.

**Conclusion:** Not suitable as a standalone solution for finding the shortest evacuation route.

## Divide and Conquer (DAC)

**Strengths:**
- Effective at breaking large problems into smaller independent subproblems.
- Used in algorithms like Merge Sort and Binary Search.
- Could theoretically partition the road network into sub-regions for parallel processing.

**Weaknesses:**
- Shortest path problems involve **overlapping subproblems** with shared state (distances to intermediate nodes). DAC assumes subproblems are independent, which they are not here.
- Merging sub-solutions from partitioned graph halves is non-trivial and may miss cross-partition optimal paths.
- No standard DAC shortest path algorithm exists for general weighted graphs.

**Conclusion:** Not well-suited for single-source shortest path in a general weighted graph.

## Dynamic Programming (DP)

**Strengths:**
- Handles overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure — both properties that shortest paths possess (Bellman's principle of optimality).
- Bellman-Ford is a DP-based shortest path algorithm that handles negative edge weights.
- Systematic and provably correct.

**Weaknesses:**
- Bellman-Ford (a DP approach) runs in O(VE) time — significantly slower than Dijkstra's O((V + E) log V) for graphs with non-negative weights.
- The overhead of DP table construction is unnecessary when edge weights are all non-negative (as in our scenario — travel times cannot be negative).
- Memory usage for DP tables can become significant on dense graphs.

**Conclusion:** DP (via Bellman-Ford) is correct but less efficient than Dijkstra's Algorithm for this specific scenario, where all weights are non-negative travel times.

## Greedy Algorithms

**Strengths:**
- Simple and fast — make locally optimal choices at each step.
- Dijkstra's Algorithm is itself a **greedy algorithm** that always extends the shortest known path next.
- Works well when the greedy choice leads to globally optimal outcomes (as it does for non-negative weighted shortest paths).

**Weaknesses:**
- Greedy approaches **do not always yield globally optimal solutions** — for instance, a greedy road selection based only on the shortest next segment (without considering the full path) could lead to a dead end or longer total route.
- A naïve greedy approach (always take the shortest adjacent road) is not the same as Dijkstra's Algorithm and is not guaranteed to be optimal.

**Conclusion:** Dijkstra's Algorithm — which formalises greedy selection with a priority queue and cumulative distance tracking — is the optimal greedy approach for this problem.

## Graph Algorithms

**Strengths:**
- Directly model the road network as a graph G = (V, E) with weighted edges.
- Dijkstra's Algorithm (graph algorithm) solves the single-source shortest path problem optimally for non-negative weights in O((V + E) log V) time with a min-priority queue.
- BFS solves unweighted shortest path; Dijkstra solves weighted — perfectly matching our scenario.
- Floyd-Warshall computes all-pairs shortest paths if multiple simultaneous evacuation scenarios are needed.
- The graph representation naturally encodes road junctions (vertices), roads (edges), and travel times (weights).

**Weaknesses:**
- Graph algorithms require the problem to be modelled correctly as a graph — missing or incorrect edge weights lead to wrong results.
- Dijkstra's Algorithm does not support negative edge weights (not an issue here since travel time is always non-negative).
- For very large road networks (thousands of nodes), more advanced algorithms (A*, bidirectional Dijkstra) may be preferred for speed.

**Conclusion:** **Graph algorithms — specifically Dijkstra's Algorithm — are the most suitable solution paradigm for this problem.**

## Dijkstra's Algorithm: The Optimised Choice

For the landslide medical evacuation scenario, **Dijkstra's Algorithm** is the most effective approach because:

1. The problem is naturally modelled as a weighted graph (road junctions as vertices, road segments as edges, travel time as weights).
2. All edge weights (travel times) are non-negative — the fundamental requirement for Dijkstra's correctness.
3. It guarantees the globally shortest (fastest) path from the hospital to the village, not just a locally optimal one.
4. It runs efficiently — O((V + E) log V) with a priority queue — fast enough for real-time emergency dispatch.
5. It systematically evaluates all possible routes through the surviving road network, leaving nothing to chance.

While Dynamic Programming (Bellman-Ford) is also correct, it is unnecessarily slow for this scenario. Dijkstra's Algorithm is the industry-standard choice for non-negative weighted shortest path problems and is the optimal selection here.
