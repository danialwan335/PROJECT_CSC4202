# 1.1 Scenario and Problem

## Geographical Setting

The scenario takes place in the rural highland region of Hulu Selangor, Selangor, Malaysia — a mountainous area connected to the nearest urban hospital (Hospital Kuala Kubu Bharu) via a combination of federal roads and unpaved logging tracks. During the Northeast Monsoon season (October–March), this region routinely receives heavy rainfall that destabilises hillslopes saturated with laterite soil.

## The Disaster: Landslide Event

On the night of 14 November 2025, a severe landslide triggered by three consecutive days of monsoon rain completely blocks Jalan Hulu Bernam, the main federal highway connecting the highland village of Kampung Sungai Lui to the town of Kuala Kubu Bharu. A large debris flow measuring approximately 200 metres in width buries the road under several metres of earth and rock, rendering it impassable for all motor vehicles.

At 03:15 AM, a 58-year-old resident, Mr. Ahmad bin Ramli, suffers a suspected myocardial infarction (heart attack). His family calls the emergency services immediately. However, the nearest ambulance from Hospital Kuala Kubu Bharu cannot take the main highway — it is completely blocked.

## The Problem

The emergency response team must navigate through a fragmented network of **surviving secondary roads** — narrow logging tracks, plantation access roads, and forest reserve paths — to reach Kampung Sungai Lui and transport the patient to the hospital.

This road network is **irregular and partially damaged**: some segments remain passable, others are blocked by fallen trees or minor landslides, and each road segment carries a different **travel time in minutes**, reflecting road condition, gradient, distance, and visibility.

The central challenge is:

> **Given the surviving road network modelled as a weighted graph, find the fastest (shortest-time) route from Hospital Kuala Kubu Bharu (source) to Kampung Sungai Lui (destination) so that the ambulance arrives in minimum time.**

## Problem Statement

Given a weighted, undirected graph G = (V, E), where:
- **V** is a set of road junctions or landmarks (nodes/vertices),
- **E** is a set of surviving road segments connecting them (edges),
- each edge (u, v) carries a **non-negative weight w(u, v)** representing the estimated travel time in minutes,

find the **single-source shortest path** from the hospital (source node s) to the patient's village (destination node d) that minimises the total travel time.

## Why This Is an Important Problem

Every minute of delay in cardiac emergency response reduces the patient's survival probability. Medical research (Door-to-Balloon guidelines) recommends reperfusion therapy within 90 minutes of first medical contact. An unoptimised route — one chosen arbitrarily or by intuition — could cost the patient's life. The problem therefore demands a provably optimal, computationally reliable algorithmic solution, not guesswork.
