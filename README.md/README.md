# 🚑 Landslide Medical Evacuation Route Optimiser

A Java-based algorithmic solution to find the fastest ambulance route through a post-landslide road network using **Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm** (Graph Paradigm).

## 📖 Scenario

Heavy monsoon rains cause a severe landslide in Hulu Selangor, blocking the main highway. An emergency ambulance must navigate a network of logging tracks and secondary roads to reach a cardiac patient in Kampung Sungai Lui.

**Algorithm Goal:** Find the minimum-time route from Hospital Kuala Kubu Bharu (Node 0) to Kampung Sungai Lui (Node 7) through the surviving road network.
